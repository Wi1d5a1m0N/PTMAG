## The Penetration Tester's Manual Attack Guide

Welcome Pen Testers! This is a work in progress, clearly in the infant stage. Please feel free to make suggestions for additions, subtractions, or changes.

### Why?
After completing OSCP and starting my study for OSCE I realized that there were alot of lessons I had to learn the hard way (i.e. banging my head against a wall and researching the most abstract things until 2am) and that while there is a ton of resources out there for this course, there really wasn't anything out there (that I could find) that gave a inclusive all-in-one experience. Some notes would have useful commands for exploitation/privilege escalation and some would have helpful things to think about, while others just kinda sprayed their experience out not really providing anything concrete to grasp.

Into my head pops this idea. I will be planning out this bash script, adding ideas, links to resources, and things to think about in the hopes that I can at least help light the way for some of you aspiring peers. Take this at face value, as this will not be the "end all, be all" of pen-testing guides. The cyber world is ever changing, so I will make my best attempts to keep this updated, but understand I am not perfect and a novice in the world of penetration testing and programming.

### Disclaimer
-This script is intended for use in private testing environments in which the user has expressed, explicit consent to test the security implementation, and policies of the information systems.  
-This script is not be used for malicious purposes. Any unintended use malicious or otherwise is not the Author's responsibility. (I will not be responsible for your idiocy)  
-This script is presented as is, if it breaks or doesn't work for you, it's probably because of your custom environment despite my efforts to make this universally supported by all linux/unix systems. However, I welcome suggestions for optimization or if there is a fatal error in the code. (Let's try to help each other out!)

### P.S.
Again this is a work in progress, so please excuse the mess, the lack of support, and the lack of material. I will be adding everything as fast and as efficient as I can. Thanks for your understanding fellow Pen-Testers!

### Setup
This script requires figlet be installed, run the setup.sh and it will auto install figlet and the required font appropriately.
